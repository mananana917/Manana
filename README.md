Let's Get to know me.
Hola! Bonjour! Nǐn hǎo! Konnichiwa! Anyoung haseyo!
Hello, I am Cherry Mirra Calisnao of BSCS 1A.
A 19 years old student of WVSU under the CICT department.
Residing at Brgy. Jamog, Tigbauan, Iloilo.
The eldest daughter among the three.

In fact, I am a person who is very dedicated, organized, and methodical. I'm also willing to learn and improve my skills. I am reliable and dependable and often seek new responsibilities given to me. I am determined and decisive to find and take advantage of opportunities.

Skills: Right now, I don not have any skills to be proud of. I am still honing my skills in programming and things that are related to my course.
Hobbies: I love doing nothing. But kidding aside, I am fond of editing pictures and lay outing some infographics. 
Likes: What I like the most is sleeping. I can sleep for 12 hours.
        I also love coffee. Everytime I feel so stress, I just drink coffee and it makes me calm.
        I really love to travel despite the fact that I have a motion sickness.
 
 My expectation in this Class: I expect that this class will help me to sharpen my skills and knowledge about computer graphics, as well as help me learn new things.
